# Tech Blog MVC Project

# Hi there, my name is Alexander Giannini and this is my Tech Blog project! This is a full stack project where I created both the Frontend and the Backend of this site. With this site, users are able to login and sign up to use extended functionality for this website. Afterwards users are able to create new posts, read other posts, delete posts, comment on posts, and edit posts. This application is very convenient when discussing tech topics, so please enjoy!
